# Learning to code

???
Since you chose this parallel session, I assume you are not very familiar with coding and/or the Terminal? Is that true for everyone? 

--

Where to start learning code/Bash?

--

- Strive to be "lazy"

--

- Google

--

- Talk to others about "life hacks"

--

- Metric tons of TRIAL AND ERROR (tears, manic screaming, blood...)


--

Code is reproducable and eliminates human error (unlike copy-pasting).

???
Better to code sth in 4x the time it takes to do it manually, if it saves you 1000x the time in the long run!

Plus, if you apply what you will learn these two days, you can hopefully saving others from having to rerun everything from scratch to replicate your work!

This will save humanity countless hours!

---

# Aims of this session

- **Aims:**

  - To get you comfortable enough with the terminal to try it out
  - Make your work more efficient by using code:
        - Save time!
        - Make your work more reproducible!
        - Eliminate human error!
        - Look like a ~~computer nerd~~ really cool!

--
<br>

- **Objectives:**

  1. What is a terminal?
  2. How to navigate around your computer with the terminal?
  3. How to interact with text files?


---
# What is a Terminal? And what is bash?

A terminal is a window in which you communicate with the computer.
Bash is the *language* you use to comunicate with the computer.

Metaphorically:
 - The Terminal is the room we are all in right now.
  
 - Bash is the language we are using to communicate (English).

What you see here is the "command prompt". username@server:pwd$
me, at the workshop server. ~ means "my HOME directory" (user specific).

# Always mind the $!

<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/studiosoriginals-gilphabet-3o84U72tKO389H2lI4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o84U72tKO389H2lI4/giphy.gif" ></p>

???
in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables.

---

# Navigating the maze

`pwd` stands for "__p__rint __w__rite __d__irectory" 
```bash
$ pwd
```
???
As we mentioned, _~_ is your _home directory_. But where _is_ your home?
--

```
/home/thiseas
```
???
This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the "root" 
(a specific directory on the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your 
particular folder. 

Each user has their own home directory!

---

# Let's talk about paths!

.left-column-66[
While walking around downtown Jena, you feel a rumble in your belly, and feel a craving that only a _currywurst with sweet potato fries_ can fulfill. 

You look around and see a stranger sitting under __the statue of Kurfürst Johann Friedrich.__ You approach the stranger and ask them for directions to Fritz Mitte!]

# Absolute paths

.left-column-66[
The location of a file or folder, __from the “root” directory__ (`/`).

]

.right-column-33[

--

.left-column-66[

Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte, from Jentower (the de facto landmark in Jena).


>___“From Jentower, cross Leutragraben and turn right. You will see FM 100m ahead!”___
<p align="right"><i>Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>
]




???
These directions are true no matter where in town you happen to be.

--

.left-column-66[

__Example of an absolute path:__
```
/home/thiseas
```
]
???
__Absolute__ paths always start with `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` translates to the absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.


---

# Relative paths

.left-column-66[
The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__
]

.right-column-33[

.left-column-66[

Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte from your current location.

>___“Go down that road, turn left, then keep going straight until you see it!”___
<p align="right"><i>also Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

]

???
These directions are easier to follow, but only work if you begin AT MARKTPLATZ.

--

.left-column-66[
__Example of a relative path:__
```
./../Documents/Memes/Pepe.png
../Documents/Memes/Pepe.png
```
]
???
__Relative__ paths are always relative to your working directory (i.e.
  your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (`./`) 
  or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash. 

In the syntax of relative paths `.` means "the current directory" and `..` means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above'). 

---

# The contents of a directory

`ls` is shorthand for **l**i**s**t. 

```bash
$ ls

```
???
Now let's look around at our current location and see what we can find within 
our home directory.

`ls` is shorthand for "list". It will (surprise surprise) list the contents of the current directory.

This will produce no output, since your current directory is empty. Let's change that!
--
<br><br>
`mkdir` is shorthand for "**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

```bash
$ mkdir ~/BBB
$ ls ~
```
???
You can make a new empty directory using the command `mkdir`, shorthand for 
"**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

--
```
BBB
```
Now that your home directory is not empty, `ls` has output!
???
Also notice that if we provide a path to `ls`, it will list the contents of the given directory.

---

# Directory Management

__However, `BBB` is not a very descriptive name.__

???
In two years when you start looking through these folders `BBB` won't mean much and you will likely go like this. (click)

--

<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/it-crowd-moss-computer-throw-gif-5404468" src="https://media.tenor.co/images/d82c7edc4b04227b4c973f24b904695f/raw" width="35%"></p>

--

**Important:** keep your corner of the computer well organised!
- The trick: make own directories. 
- Often, _a lot_ of them. 

--

But don't lose hope, as we can rename things with the `mv` command, 
shorthand for "**m**o**v**e". 

```bash
$ mv ~/BBB BareBonesBash

```
???
In fact move, as the name suggests, will move a file/folder into a new location, 
also renaming it in the process if necessary. It works by typing `mv`, the old 
location and a target location.

__Can you tell me what type of path each argument to the command used is?__

---
# Directory Management

```bash
$ ls
```
```
BareBonesBash

</p>

???
Wait... This isn't BareBonesBash. It's RRDM! Let's just delete that empty directory and start over.
--
`rmdir` is short for "**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory"
???
__rmdir only works on EMPTY directories!__
--

```bash
$ rmdir ~/BareBonesBash
$ ls
```
???
Now your home directory is empty again.

</p>

--
```bash
$ mkdir ~/ReproducibleResearchDataManagement/IntroToBash
```
--
```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘~/ReproducibleResearchDataManagement/IntroToBash’: No such file or directory
```
???
By default, bash will try to create the directory specified. But this will fail when making nested directories where the parents don't exist!
--

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/ReproducibleResearchDataManagement/IntroToBash
$ ls
```
???
The `-p` is called a FLAG or OPTION. `-p` stand for PARENT and tells the computer to make the given directory AND ALL directories lesding to it, if they do not exist.
--
```
ReproducibleResearchDataManagement
```
Much better!

---

# Navigating the file system
`cd` is short for "__c__hange __d__irectory".

```bash
$ cd ReproducibleResearchDataManagement
$ ls
```
```
IntroToBash
```
???

Now that we have our directory, we should move into it. 
--
???
You can see that your current directory has changed on your command prompt! (or you can use `pwd`).

`ls` now lists the contents of the RRDM directory, which has IntroToBash in it!
--

<br>
To move to the parent directory of your current location:
```bash
$ cd ..
```
--

```bash
$ cd ~/ReproducibleResearchDataManagement/IntroToBash
```
???
You can also use an abosolute path to move to a directory:

# Downloading files

We are going to download a FASTQ file from the ENA (European Nucleotide Archive). This should be pretty quick!

???
The data we will use are sequenced pieces of mtDNA from Mammoths!

For all intents and purposes of this session, this file is just a text file.

--

```bash
## Download!
### Linux/Windows
$ wget ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz
### Mac
$ curl -LO ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz
$ mv ERR2020601.fastq.gz ERR2020601.fastq.gz.Z

## Then to check if the file is now in our working directory
$ ls
```
???
Notice how I have used comments to explain what the different sections of the code do!

--

<br/>
- That's because the FASTQ file is _compressed_ 
  - As with almost all FASTQs 
  - Also most large text files
  - as indicated by the `.gz` (`.gz.Z` for Mac users)


---

## Viewing the gz

To view the _human readable_ contents of the file, we 
can instead use `zcat`. Don't forget your auto-complete!

--

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz

```
???
You still got a bunch of junk printed on your screen, but this time it's the junk we wanted! 
--

---

## Taking it slow

Using `cat`/`zcat`, we got the entire contents of the file printed to our screen.

This is rarely what you want with large files like this one.

First off, let's fully uncompress the file:
```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz >ERR2020601.fastq
```
--

You can now look through just parts of the file, which is way more useful!

- `head` will show you just the top of the file.
- While `tail` will only show the end.
- Alternatively, you can use `less` to scroll through the entire file at your own pace.
  - `less` will open a "viewer", so a window within your terminal. to quit press `q`.

???
Feel free to try these now.
--

> BONUS TIP TIME: Just like `zcat` is the `cat` of compressed files, <br>
> `zless` is the `less` of compressed files!

## What EXACTLY is compression?

- Compression is a way of saving hard-disk space
  - finds common patterns and replace with a smaller (repeated)-value
  - later translated back (decompression)

_But I had 800 songs, and still had space_ - I hear you call?

# Asking for help

How to find out how much less space our FASTQ takes up because of compression? 
  - Let's ask the computer to help us find a way! 

--

First - how to find out what a program does? Ask `whatis`!

```bash
$ whatis man
```

--

```
man (1)              - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
```

DESCRIPTION
       Gzip  reduces  the  size  of  the  named  files using Lempel-Ziv coding
       (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  the
       extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modi‐
       fication times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS,  z  for  MSDOS,
       OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if
       a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed  to  the  standard
       output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particu‐
       lar, it will ignore symbolic links.

```

- To navigate:
  - Scroll up and down with arrow keys
  - Quit press `q` on your keyboard

Scroll until you see `OPTIONS` - what does `--list` do?

???
`zcat` is just one way to call on `gzip` to uncompress the zipped file.

It is similar to how the names "Snoop-Dogg" and "Snoop-Doggy-Dogg" are the same person.

---

# Oooooooh

The option `--list`/`-l` lists 
  - the size of a file in both compressed and uncompressed form
  - the compression ratio (how effective the 
compression was). 

--

**Most programmes you will use DO have a `man` page, making this command 
extremely useful.**.

--

Lets try our new found knowledge!

```bash
$ gzip -l ERR2020601.fastq.gz

```
--
```
         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
             217232              864983  74.9% ERR2020601.fastq
```
<br/>

Not bad! Our file 25.1% the size of the uncompressed file would.

???
Try to compress all large files before you share them with people.

Also a good idea to compress data files that you don't actively use anymore, or REALLY large data files.

That way you can turn some files that are 2GB into 0.5GB. It's free real estate!

# Text Editing in the Terminal

# Text Editing in the Terminal

Often, you will need to quickly edit the contents of a text file in your terminal. 

The most common way to do this is to use `nano`.
```bash
$ whatis nano
```
```
nano (1)             - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone
```

---
# nano
So open up the program with

```bash
$ nano
```
--

Upon running `nano` your screen will change. You are now in a "viewer window" (i.e. a window within your terminal).
- Try typing something!
- Move the white cursor around with your arrow keys.

--

You can start typing whatever you want to save in the file, just like you would in Notepad.

To go to the next line, just press Enter.
???
If you cannot think of anything you want to write currently, just write the names of your two favourite fruits!

# IT'S A TRAP!

You are now trapped in the nano viewer!

# nano

- Look at the bottom of the window for keyboard shortcuts

  - These correspond to different commands (save, exit, etc.)
  - `^` corresponds to your `ctrl` key on your keyboard

--
<br>
<br>
<br>

- To save the contents of your file:
  1. Initiate exit with `ctrl + x`
  2. You will be prompted to 'Save modified buffer'.
  3. Press `y` on your keyboard to agree
  4. Set the file name as `my_file.txt`
  5. Press `enter` to save

All done!

---

# Editing existing files

```bash
$ ls
```
```
my_file.txt
```
???
You can now see the file you just created in your active directory.

--

You can now edit it's contents by telling nano which file you wish to edit.
```bash
nano my_file.txt
```

--
In the viewer window you will now see that your two favourite fruits are already in the file.

Let's add your **least** favourite vegetable at the end of the list!

???
Probably okra

--

- Follow the same procedure to save the file.
- You will notice that this time the filename was already there at the third step. 
- This is essentially the same as the "Overwrite changes" pop-up in Notepad/Word.

# Delete...


Time to hide our tracks...

So far, we learnt `rmdir` to remove a directory. 

To remove a file, we can instead use `rm` for – you guessed it! – **r**e**m**ove. 
]
???
I bet it felt good to share your most/least favourite fruits and veggies with the computer!

But now it's time to make sure it keeps your secret FOREVER!
